# Module-10 Nonparametric Statistical Analysis

Parametric statistical analyses make the assumption that measurement noise is normally distributed. 
In practice, however, many measurements do not meet this requirement. 

Although Linear Mixed Models (See Parametric Statistics Module) are quite robust against such violations of normality, nonparametric methods are a useful alternative. 

## Objectives 
At the end of this module you can
 - Describe the differences between parametric and nonparmetric methods
 - Give nonparametric alternatives for some parametric methods.
 - Use bootstrapping and permutation tests to roll your own nonparametric statistical tests.
